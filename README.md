# AF Grobler Project (E) 448 2020
This repository hosts the files and algorithms that were developed for my final year project.

# Topic

Develop a power efficient, offline camera surveillance system that stores images on a central repository. All components should be linked by a wireless connection. Background algorithms must be able to sort through images, reduce the amount of images stored by motion detection, and ensure that the storage device does not reach capacity. Machine learning code that is able classify and sort images will greatly enhance functionality.

# Software

All the software required for this project can be found in the 'python' directory. All algorithms are developed in the components.py file, thus making this the most important file to view.

# Physical components used

- Raspberry Pi Model 4B (4GB)
- High accuracy real time clock for Raspberry Pi
- Foscam IP camera
- Zosi IP camera
