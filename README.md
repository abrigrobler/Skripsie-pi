# AF Grobler Project (E) 448 2020

This repository hosts the files and algorithms that were developed for my final year project.

# Topic

Develop an offline camera surveillance system that stores images on a central repository. All components should be linked by a wireless connection. Background algorithms must be able to sort through images, reduce the amount of images stored by motion detection, and ensure that the storage device does not reach capacity.

# Software

All the software required for this project can be found in the 'python' directory. All algorithms are developed in the components.py file, thus making this the most important file to view. Note that the components used in the final system are located in components_reduced.py
